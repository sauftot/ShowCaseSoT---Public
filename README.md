# ShowCaseSoT---Public
 NightBot API Consumer to update Sea of Thieves Season 8 PvP Stats, running as OBS Script

# WTF is this?
OBS Studio features its own Python Module to allow scripts to access its functionality directly. This plugin builds on that module.
Using the Sea of Thieves profile page, it will automatically retrieve (at its current state) your Reaper PvP Faction Wins and Level.
It will then use that information to change a Nightbot command on your Twitch channel.
