 NightBot API Consumer to update Sea of Thieves Season 8 PvP Stats, running as OBS Script

# What is this?
OBS Studio features a Python Module to allow scripts to access its functionality directly. This plugin builds on that module.
Using the Sea of Thieves profile page, it will automatically retrieve your desired PvP Faction's Wins and Level.
It will then use that information to change a Nightbot command on your Twitch channel. 

In order to run this, you will need to register an Application in your NightBot Control Panel and input its "id" and "secret" information into this script. You will also need the ids of your "!wins! and "!levels" commands. If you have no other way of finding out about these, you can run the respective script included in this repo with your id and secret nightbot information inserted.
